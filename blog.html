        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Our E-commerce portfolio project was a challenging and rewarding experience for our team. We set out to create an online marketplace for small businesses to sell their products, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use for both the business owners and shoppers.</p>
        <p>The team consisted of three members: Bright as a frontend developer, Daniel as the project fullstack engineer, and John as a backend developer. We worked together over a period of three weeks to bring our vision to life.</p>

        <h2>The Story</h2>
        <p>The inspiration for this project came from our personal experiences shopping at small, local businesses. We wanted to create a platform that would make it easy for these businesses to reach a wider audience and grow their sales post Covid-19 lockdown. Our goal was to create a user-friendly and visually appealing platform that would make the shopping experience enjoyable for customers.</p>

        <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
        <p>Despite the challenges, we were able to accomplish a lot with this project. We created a fully functional and visually appealing e-commerce platform that small businesses can use to sell their products online. We also learned a lot about the importance of user experience and the importance of security in online transactions.</p>

        <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
        <p>One of the most difficult challenges we faced was implementing a secure payment system. We had to ensure that sensitive customer information was protected and comply with industry standards for online transactions. This required a significant amount of research and testing, and giving the scope of our mvp and the development period for this project, we opted to provide a checkout form to ensure that we were able to provide a secure and reliable checkout process for our customers.</p>

        <h2>Learnings and Takeaways</h2>
        <p>Working on this project taught us a lot about ourselves as engineers and about the importance of user-centered design. It also reinforced the importance of security and compliance in online transactions. It has been a great learning experience and we hope to continue working on similar projects in the future.</p>
