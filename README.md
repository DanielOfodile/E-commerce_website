# E-commerce Website
This is a virtual `E-commerce Website` developed using the Django web
framework, Python, and SQLite. It includes the core functionality and
features needed to support online sales and customer management, as well
as a basic design and user interface.
It provides an online shopper with a list of the various products available
for purchase in the store. To make online shopping easier, a shopping cart
is available for users to add items to as they browse. Once the desired
goods have been selected, the user can proceed to the order confirmation
process.

## Requirements
To run this program, you will need the `requirement.txt` file list installed
on your system.

3. Download python.
4. Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. [Optional - Not a prerequisite] Create the database and run migrations:
